# BibTeX Actions

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT ATM

## What is it?

This package turns bibtex-completion functions into completing-read-based Emacs commands. 
When used with selectrum, embark, and marginalia, it provides similar functionality to helm-bibtex and ivy-bibtex: quick filtering and selecting of bibliographic entries from the minibuffer, and the option to run different commands against them.

Here's a screenshot with selectrum and embark.
